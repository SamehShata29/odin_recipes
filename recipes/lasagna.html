    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Lasagna</strong>, also known as <strong>lasagne</strong>, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets.</p>
    <p>The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce),<br>béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil pasta:</strong> Cook in a large pot of salted water.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer & bake:</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
